<p> hi. I am not an interesting person. I am me. I won't tell you my age or name because I shall be smart. Call me Estelle or "My sin to the law". That means I'm underage so yeah. Online I take on the title Estelle usually. Estelle is an OC of mine, if you really want to know. I will be discribing how I am online and in real life in the next paragraph.</p>
<br>
<p> Online I am a perfect interset I'm dirty, flirty, and emotional. I tend to do things too easily so I want to see how long it takes me to break. Anyways I use discord a lot because I meet a lot of people I like. My name on discord is Im Illegal#7409 if you really want to know. When you meet me there don't ask for n00dz you perv, I'm illegal. I've already gotten through a catfish so I think I'm pretty good at trusting my gut and not my heart XD. Anyways message me in discord if you want to talk more.</p>
<br>
<p> Now in real life I'm a shy bitch. I know that doesn't make any sense but I am. I hate meeting new people but I'm confertable with my friends. I tend to bottle things up and explode at them later on. I've been dealing with a lot of drama in my friend group because everyone never keeps their promises and forgets things so easily. It gets me really mad. The other day my friend yelled at me for crying then I started actually crying and she STARTED TALKING SHIT TO OTHER PEOPLE AND I WAS MAD SDFDSF;ADFHSFDSA;LH</p>
